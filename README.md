💡Inspiration💡
Achieving a healthy lifestyle and knowing technology is a difficulty the elderly confront a lot at their age. We're living longer, but is the quality of our lives improving as a result? We devised a plan to combine healthcare, technology, and personal profession to address the existing unmet needs of older adults who want to live comfortably. The goal is to improve the lives of the elderly by allowing them to be healthy and live to their full capacity as they age. We're here to look after their career, relieve stress, and give them peace of mind.

❓What it does❓
We offer a web-based application that connects elderly carers with the elderly in an effective and transparent manner. Better systems provide more individualised care and less administration, leaving them with less troublesome tasks and pursuing their passions. It will make bookings, communication, and reports more accessible for them. We have work opportunities that have been specifically curated for them so that their age does not become a barrier to their work interest. We also understand that being overwhelmed with new technology is normal in this age, so we've divided everything into devices and processes for their convenience and to help them climb the ladder of technology and not feel left behind by the generation.

🏗️How we built it🏗️
We built the application using HTML/CSS/JS and used Auth0 for authentication.

🚧Challenges we ran into🚧
We had a tough time coming up with an idea that has a practical use case and can really help the targeted users with the problems they face in real life. We have ideas for other features that we'd like to include in the future, but we wanted to make sure that what we had was production-ready and had a pleasant user experience first.

🏅🏆ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF🏅🏆
We completed the front-end and somewhat backend of the programme within the tight deadlines we were given, and we are quite pleased with the final outcome.

📚🙋‍♂️What we Learned 📚🙋‍♂️
We learned to create a minimalist website to solve a problem. This problem required innovation and research in the ideation stage and design, building upon our knowledge of programming. -Utilization of the Auth0, Twilio and Coil for Authentication, to send SMS text messages to users in a streamlined and convenient manner.

💭What's next for Gowth4Elderly💭
We will work together to ensure that the elderly are content and that all of their issues are addressed. Different features to assist them in smoothing the procedure, and our platform will quickly adapt to this in the near future.
